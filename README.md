This is the repo for my [Deluxe Blog Tips](https://deluxeblogtips.com) blog.

The website is built with the following tools:

- WordPress for managing content.
- A blank WordPress theme. See the `theme` folder.
- [MB Views](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-views/) for creating templates for homepage, archive pages, posts and pages. Views are stored in the `views` folder. Each view has its own template, style, script files with instructions in the `README.md` file.
- Icons in the header are from [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com).
- Comments use Github issues via [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es).
- Social images are auto generated via [cards.microlink.io](https://cards.microlink.io).
